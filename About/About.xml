	<description>Vanilla Races Expanded is a brand new series of mods to enhance Biotech features, add to the storytelling and the world-building of RimWorld, and to introduce new, cool types of xenohumans, complete with their own unique genes, behaviors, mechanics and items.

Our goal for Vanilla Races Expanded - Pigskin was to make the pigskin xenotype a little bit more unique and to have it tie to the existing pigskin lore and their origin. You can expect to get access to a variety of new genes that will make it easier to create a fast growing, nutrient-rich human that can be butchered to yield pork and pigskin. On top of that, a new Boarskin xenotype may appear in pigskin raids now. They are tougher, harder, braver and generally visually different thanks to the big tusks protruding from their mouths.

The inclusion of the organ regeneration gene will allow your pigskins to regrow any missing organs, which should make them more than viable for some cheeky organ harvesting operations. The ever-growing gene will allow you to make colossal warriors that will become more stagger resistant and survivable with age. The rapid growth gene is perfect for vat grown soldiers as it will age them, well, rapidly, which means they will be ready to serve much sooner. The coward gene will allow you to control your slave population easily, and the inclusion of the pork flesh will mean that you will be able to grow the ultimate livestock in your back garden.

Damn, it’s one of the most wicked mods we’ve done so far, on par with cat girl highmates.</description>
